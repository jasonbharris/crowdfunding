Hello and welcome to the Crowdfunding project from Frontend Mentor that I am creating using the help of Svelte JS.

If you would like to view this project. just clone this project and
type in `npm init` to download the dependencies for the project.
Then all you have to do is type `npm run dev` and it will start a development server with the project for you to view.

The font that I am using for this project is: font-family: "Commissioner", serif; with the weights: 400, 500, 700;
